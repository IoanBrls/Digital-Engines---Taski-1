# Digital_Engines-Task_1
Simple Unity Code for making a stream of cubes move in a sinusoidal way

This project was implemented during my M.Sc. in Digital Game at the University of Malta.
The task was to implement scripts that would instantiate a stream of cubes and then animate them as a sine wave.

Valuables' Description:
- offset: the distance between each cube
- frequency: determimes the delay of the movement between each cube
- magnitude: the magnitude of the sine wave
- Number_of_Cubes: the number of the cubes we want
- Animation: when enabled the cubes move. If In_Sync is not enabled the cubes move as a sine wave.
- In_Sync: when activated the cubes movement is syncronised
- Vortex: creates the Vortex effect. The higher the value the more intense the vortex is.
